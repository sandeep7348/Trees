ðŸŒ³ Tree Data Structure Implementation in C++ (or your language)

This project contains the implementation of various tree data structures and related algorithms, designed to provide a foundational understanding of hierarchical data organization and traversal techniques.

âœ… Key Features:

Binary Tree & Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

Node structure using classes

Insertion, deletion, and search operations

Tree Traversals

Inorder, Preorder, Postorder (recursive & iterative)

Level Order Traversal (BFS using Queue)

Advanced Functionalities

Find height/depth of tree

Check for balanced tree

Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

Mirror/Invert a binary tree

Custom Utility Functions

Serialize/deserialize binary tree

Count leaf and non-leaf nodes

Path sum and diameter of tree
